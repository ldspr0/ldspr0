### Hello 👋

- My name is Aleksandr Ivanov, I'm 37 old.
- 🔭 I'm Sr. Salesforce Developer. I worked with it more than 8 years both as a Developer and an Administrator.
- 🏅 I have few Salesforce Certifications: 
    - Salesforce Certified Platform Developer I
    - Salesforce Certified Administrator
    - Salesforce Certified Sales Cloud Consultant
      
- 📫 And now I Study Java on Ya.Practicum to get more knowledge of it.
- 🌱 I love to learn more about Programming Architecture and Enterprise Patterns (and their performance).

- p.s. I'm sorry, but you probably will not be able to find anything interesting under my repositories as most of my work is Private.
